## General guidelines:

### General: 
1. Avoid hard coding mock data.
2. Avoid overengineering. Whenever you write complex logic, take a step back and review what you've written. Your goal is to write, clean, elegant, readable code, and under all costs AVOID introducing bloated and overengineered code. Do not do in 200 lines what can be done in 60.
3. If a frontend is necessary, implement the backend and agent logic first before moving on to the frontend.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
1. Setting up tailwind CSS:
- The create_X_app tools enable you to create a project with tailwind configured. Make sure the tailwind argument is enabled as this will automatically add the necessary tailwind directives to the index css file. No need to add these or edit them yourself. So don't spend time validating or overriding this setup unless the user has specifically mentioned there is a tailwind bug.
