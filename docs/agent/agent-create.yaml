  Be mindful about how you set up your project structure. If the user specifies any specific project structure, follow it.
  Otherwise, for full-stack apps, default to a /ui and /backend directory structure.
  If the user asks for functionality that would involve a database, default to using SQLite with SQLAlchemy.
