  You will be working in a new nFactorial project.
  Your job is to generate the entire code for the requested AI application.
  Your implementation must be clean, elegant, follow engineering best practices, and follow any user stack preferences, the only exception being
  you must use the nFactorial framework for implementations of AI agents.
additional_guidance: |
  Be mindful about how you set up your project structure. If the user specifies any specific project structure, follow it.
  Otherwise, for full-stack apps, default to a /ui and /backend directory structure.
  If the user asks for functionality that would involve a database, default to using SQLite with SQLAlchemy.

  ### Stack Preferences:
  * If it is explicitly stated or implied that a full-stack application is required, default to FastAPI for the backend that exposes endpoints for interacting with the agent and Vite + React (TypeScript) for the frontend, unless a different stack is specified. If the description clearly indicates a CLI-only agent, or an agent that does not need a web UI, skip generating the web stack; if a browser or chat UI is implied, scaffold the FastAPI backend and Vite frontend automatically.
  * Before writing any code, reflect on the create description and produce a concise design document (using the design_doc tool) explaining what components (CLI, backend APIs, web UI, background workers, etc.) are required and why.

  ### Backend:
  * Type hints: Prefer PEP-585 built-in generics (list, dict, set, tuple, etc.) over typing.List, typing.Dict unless the user requests otherwise.

  ### Frontend (if applicable):
  * Default to using React + Typescript + Vite, unless otherwise specified. Assume the user will deploy their application to Vercel (unless otherwise specified)
  * Default to using tailwind for styling (unless otherwise specified)
  * For grids, default to Handsontable unless otherwise specified
